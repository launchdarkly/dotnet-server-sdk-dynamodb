# LaunchDarkly Server-Side SDK for .NET - DynamoDB integration

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/dotnet-server-sdk-dynamodb.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/dotnet-server-sdk-dynamodb)

This library provides a DynamoDB-backed persistence mechanism (data store) for the [LaunchDarkly .NET SDK](https://github.com/launchdarkly/dotnet-server-sdk), replacing the default in-memory data store. It uses the [AWS SDK for .NET](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/).

The minimum version of the LaunchDarkly .NET SDK for use with the current version of this library is 5.14.0. For earlier versions of the SDK, use version 1.0.x of this library.

For more information, see also: [Using a persistent feature store](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/v2.0/docs/using-a-persistent-feature-store).

## .NET platform compatibility

This version of the library is compatible with .NET Framework version 4.5 and above, .NET Standard 1.6, and .NET Standard 2.0.

## Quick setup

1. In DynamoDB, create a table which has the following schema: a partition key called "namespace" and a sort key called "key", both with a string type. The LaunchDarkly library does not create the table automatically, because it has no way of knowing what additional properties (such as permissions and throughput) you would want it to have.

2. Use [NuGet](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/using-the-package-manager-console) to add this package to your project:

        Install-Package LaunchDarkly.ServerSdk.DynamoDB

3. Import the package (note that the namespace is different from the package name):

        using LaunchDarkly.Client.Integrations;

4. When configuring your `LDClient`, add the DynamoDB data store as a `PersistentDataStore`. You may specify any custom DynamoDB options using the methods of `DynamoDBDataStoreBuilder`. For instance, if you are passing in your AWS credentials programmatically from a variable called `myCredentials`:

```csharp
        var ldConfig = Configuration.Default("YOUR_SDK_KEY")
            .DataStore(
                Components.PersistentDataStore(
                    DynamoDB.DataStore("my-table-name").Credentials(myCredentials)
                )
            )
            .Build();
        var ldClient = new LdClient(ldConfig);
```

## Caching behavior

The LaunchDarkly SDK has a standard caching mechanism for any persistent data store, to reduce database traffic. This is configured through the SDK's `PersistentDataStoreBuilder` class as described in the SDK documentation. For instance, to specify a cache TTL of 5 minutes:

```csharp
        var config = Configuration.Default("YOUR_SDK_KEY")
            .DataStore(
                Components.PersistentDataStore(
                    DynamoDB.DataStore("my-table-name").Credentials(myCredentials)
                ).CacheTime(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5))
            )
            .Build();
```

## Signing

The published version of this assembly is strong-named. Building the code locally in the default Debug configuration does not use strong-naming and does not require a key file.

## Development notes

This project imports the `dotnet-base` and `dotnet-server-sdk-shared-tests` repositories as subtrees. See the `README.md` file in each of those directories for more information.

To run unit tests, you must have a local DynamoDB server. More information [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html).

Releases are done using the release script in `dotnet-base`. Since the published package includes a .NET Framework 4.5 build, the release must be done from Windows.

## About LaunchDarkly
 
* LaunchDarkly is a continuous delivery platform that provides feature flags as a service and allows developers to iterate quickly and safely. We allow you to easily flag your features and manage them from the LaunchDarkly dashboard.  With LaunchDarkly, you can:
    * Roll out a new feature to a subset of your users (like a group of users who opt-in to a beta tester group), gathering feedback and bug reports from real-world use cases.
    * Gradually roll out a feature to an increasing percentage of users, and track the effect that the feature has on key metrics (for instance, how likely is a user to complete a purchase if they have feature A versus feature B?).
    * Turn off a feature that you realize is causing performance problems in production, without needing to re-deploy, or even restart the application with a changed configuration file.
    * Grant access to certain features based on user attributes, like payment plan (eg: users on the ‘gold’ plan get access to more features than users in the ‘silver’ plan). Disable parts of your application to facilitate maintenance, without taking everything offline.
* LaunchDarkly provides feature flag SDKs for a wide variety of languages and technologies. Check out [our documentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs) for a complete list.
